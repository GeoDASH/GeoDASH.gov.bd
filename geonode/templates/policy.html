                        Some applications and/or transactions with the GeoDASH Platform may require a User to register
                        and have a unique member account, with a User name and password combination in order to access
                        and use certain features or functions of the Platform. To register, Users may be asked for
                        certain Personal Information. Except as specifically provided for in the Platform or herein, the
                        Personal Information provided is only used for technical and user administration and evaluation
                        of the Platform. The data collected is not intended to be traced back to a particular
                        individual/User. Instead, the purpose of this data collection is so that the Bangladesh Computer
                        Council (BCC) can better understand the preferences of its visitors and improve this Platform
                        and its services. In this regard, Users grant the BCC a right to use the data collected.

                    <p>
                        The BCC will not use Personal Data for marketing purposes; neither will it share Personal
                        Information with outside parties for those purposes. Nevertheless, the BCC may conserve or
                        release Personal Information if required to do so by the applicable law of a specific
                        jurisdiction or in the belief that such an action is necessary to comply with legal process,
                        enforce the present Terms and Conditions, respond to claims that any content violates the rights
                        of third parties, or protect the BCCâ€™s rights and property. In addition, GeoDASH developers may
                        store email addresses provided by users to generate a mailing list.

                        Registering for certain applications or Interactive Tools is optional. If a User chooses not to
                        register or provide Personal Information, he or she can still use the Platform. However, Users
                        who choose not to do so will not be able to use some Interactive Tools or applications or to
                        perform certain actions, such as download information or to receive certain communications, such
                        as emails and newsletters.
